Indicative battery timings:

4 days left charging - average weather but good view of sun - with 40W solar panel. June 23 - 26. 
Powered on continuously for 10 hours/day.
Detached 26th - 12V battery kept it charged until 10am Jun 29, thereafter onboard Lithium Ion took over and lasted a further [] hours.
4pm 26th -> 10am 29th = 2 complete days (including running to 3am on 29th)
Actual powered time: 36 hours from 12V 6.5AH battery.
Duty Cycle 50% (7am-7pm) would give 3 days/72 hours battery life with no sunlight.
Plus around 3 hours on SB-2299 2600mAh LiPo until shutdown. (scanning for updates to upload every 10 seconds)
